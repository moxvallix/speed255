Installing a datapack is easy. First, download the latest version of speed255 from the [releases](https://github.com/moxvallix/speed255/releases) page.

You should now have a zip file, named something like `s255-#.#.#.zip`, saved to your Downloads.

If you will use **speed255** in a world that you have not yet created, click on the "Data Packs" button in the Create New World menu. Then drag the dowloaded zip file into the Minecraft window, and select the **speed255** datapack.

If you wish to install **speed255** in an already existing world, select the world from the Singleplayer screen, and press "Edit". Press "Open World Folder", which will open the world's folder in your file manager. Drag the zip file from your Downloads into the "datapacks" folder.

### Verify the pack is working
Run the command `/summon villager ~ ~ ~ {Tags:["temp"]}`.

If the villager dies instantly, the pack is working.
