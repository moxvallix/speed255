## Overview
**speed255** has tags for all effects in game. However, to reduce impact on performance, the effects have been seperated into two categories: "main" effects, and "extra" effects.

### Main effects
These effects are ones deemed most useful for datapack creation. They include glowing, speed, jump boost, etc.

Most of the time you will be using these effects. Entities with the `effects` tag have access to these effects.

### Extra effects
These effects are deemed less useful, when it comes to datapack creation. As such, they are accessible using the `effects-extra` tag.
