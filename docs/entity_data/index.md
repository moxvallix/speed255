title: Entity Data

## Overview
**speed255** has tags for modifying the data of a given entity.

Non-player entities with the tag `entity-data` have access to these tags.

Removing an entity data tag from a player will revert the data modification. Eg. removing the tag `silent` will allow the entity to make sounds again.
